        <p class="para1">My name is Lee. I am a Texas Native. I grew up playing soccer around Dallas. I dig the idea of learning for free <span>(doesn't anybody?)</span> so that's why I'm here. The rubric said to type about myself and honestly I'm too broke to return to college even though I'm about one difficult semester away from a four year degree but I'll finish eventually! So shoutout to the Perscholas organization for giving people from all backgrounds an opportunity to learn and grow. I'm learning coding so I can enjoy more out of life just like you. Let's work hard together and make some cool shit. Sorry if I'm not supposed to swear here oops.

        <p class="para1"> Two paragraphs per page is a lot for me to ramble about myself. <br>
            I hope y'all aren't grading the content of the paragraphs because <br>
            I might lose some points here. Writing about myself might be the
            most difficult part of the assignment. I've been doing the whole
            assignment learning how to talk logically to a computer so now I can't
            specify the information you want from my brain. The rubric page is not 
            linking with my brain index.html. The coding part of the assignment is a little easier.  
            Trying to recall any memory of myself right now after relearning two computer 
            languages is as difficult as trying to form complete sentences right now. 
            That should be enough sentences for now right?
