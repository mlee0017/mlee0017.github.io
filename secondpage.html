        Yet again another paragraph about me. I can feel my brain melting away.
        I enjoy taking naps because for some reason I can't sleep for eight hours straight.
        I have two cartilage piercings I created myself with earring guns from Sally's Beauty Supply.
        It was heavily recommended in my google research not to do that but my extra ear holes are doing great. 
        I've tattooed my brother twice with a stick and poke tattoo kit. You can get one <a href="https://stickandpoketattookit.com/purchase/">here</a> and stab anyone (with their consent)!

        Hey this is the last paragraph! I did enjoy creating this, I'm interested in crafting anything with my hands. 
        I spend a lot of time writing and I want to spend more time drawing and sewing. Eventually I'd like to invest more time in tattooing and woodworking. 
        I haven't watched a lot of movies because I usually fall asleep but now I try to catch up on everything. Keyword is try because I still fall asleep. 
        I saw Gladiator, the Matrix, and Star Wars for the first time this year. Plenty of other movies too but I can't remember anything of myself right now. 
        Been staring at the screen for too long and really can't wait to take a nap.
